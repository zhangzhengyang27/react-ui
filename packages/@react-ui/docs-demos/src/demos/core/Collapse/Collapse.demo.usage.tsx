          From Bulbapedia: Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal Pokémon that has blue-green skin with
          darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of
          its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are
          visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three
          sharp claws. On Bulbasaur&apos;s back is a green plant bulb, which is grown from a seed
          planted there at birth. The bulb also conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines and
          provides it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds
          contained within.
